# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I showcase my competencies and projects in Data Science and Machine Learning.

## Contents

- [Data Manipulation](#data-manipulation)
  - Demonstrations of data manipulation techniques using Numpy and Pandas.
- [Data Visualization](#data-visualization)
  - Visualization examples using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- [Projects](#projects)
  - Featured projects including a Capstone project and a House Price Prediction model.

## [Data Manipulation](https://github.com/aharoJ/MyNoteBook/tree/main/Data_Manipulation)

Here you will find notebooks detailing operations and data manipulations with popular Python libraries.

- Numpy
  - Operations with high-performance arrays and matrices.
- Pandas
  - Data processing with powerful data structures like DataFrames and Series.

## [Data Visualization](https://github.com/aharoJ/MyNoteBook/tree/main/Data_Visualization)

Visual storytelling notebooks using data plots and charts.

- Matplotlib
  - Basic to advanced plotting techniques.
- Seaborn
  - Statistical data visualization using high-level interface.

## [Projects](https://github.com/aharoJ/MyNoteBook/tree/main/Projects)

Practical applications of machine learning and data science concepts.

- Capstone
  - An overview of an end-to-end machine learning workflow.
- House Price Prediction
  - A regression model to predict house values.
- Linear Regression
  - Simple linear regression analysis on a dataset.

## [Notes](https://github.com/aharoJ/MyNoteBook/tree/main/Notes)

The `Notes` directory is filled with markdown files, providing theoretical background and personal insights into Data Science and Machine Learning.

### Viewing Notes in Obsidian
For an enhanced experience viewing these notes, you can use Obsidian. Hereâ€™s how to install Obsidian on macOS:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" && brew install --cask obsidian
```


## Quick Start

Visit any of the directories above to see the notebooks. Clone the repository to run the notebooks locally and experiment with the code.

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/aharoJ/MyNoteBook.git
2. To explore code, navigate to the Code directory.
3. To view notes, navigate to the Notes directory. For a better experience, use Obsidian.
4. Run Python notebooks using Jupyter (ensure Jupyter is installed).
