# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository, a comprehensive resource for Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiasts. This repository houses both practical Python projects and extensive markdown notes.

## Contents

- [Code](#code)
  - Python notebooks for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning projects.
- [Notes](#notes)
  - In-depth markdown notes covering various topics in Data Science and Machine Learning.

## [Code](https://github.com/aharoJ/MyNoteBook/tree/main/Code)

Explore practical implementations and projects in the `Code` directory. This includes:

### Data Manipulation
- Detailed Python notebooks using Numpy and Pandas for data analysis.

### Data Visualization
- Examples of data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Projects
- [Neural Network Reflectance Prediction](https://github.com/aharoJ/MyNoteBook/tree/main/Code/Projects/NeuralNetworkReflectancePrediction): Developed a neural network to predict the reflectance of materials using the MERL BRDF dataset, employing deep learning techniques in Python.

- [Capstone Project](https://github.com/aharoJ/MyNoteBook/tree/main/Code/Projects/Capstone): An end-to-end machine learning workflow.
- [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/aharoJ/MyNoteBook/tree/main/Code/Projects/HousePricePrediction): Model for predicting house values.
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/aharoJ/MyNoteBook/tree/main/Code/Projects/linear%20regression): Basics and applications of linear regression.


## [Notes](https://github.com/aharoJ/MyNoteBook/tree/main/Notes)

The `Notes` directory is filled with markdown files, providing theoretical background and personal insights into Data Science and Machine Learning.

### Viewing Notes in Obsidian
For an enhanced experience viewing these notes, you can use Obsidian. Hereâ€™s how to install Obsidian on macOS:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" && brew install --cask obsidian
```

## Quick Start

Visit any of the directories above to see the notebooks. Clone the repository to run the notebooks locally and experiment with the code.

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/aharoJ/MyNoteBook.git
2. To explore code, navigate to the Code directory.
3. To view notes, navigate to the Notes directory. For a better experience, use Obsidian.
4. Run Python notebooks using Jupyter (ensure Jupyter is installed).
